Part A (a4_a):
I have been asked to write a script that creates a .bash_profile for the new users that does the following:

· sets terminal bold to ON

· sets the prompt to the name of the cwd followed by $

· makes the prompt text green

· Appends the current working directory to the PATH

· ensures that all programs and scripts can use the PATH

· sets dir as an alias for ls -l

· sets cls as an alias for clear

· shows who is currently using the server

· configures rm to prompt for confirmation before deleting a file.

· prevents bash from overwriting an existing file when redirecting output

I was tasked to write a file that does the following:

· Start sleep 2000.

· Suspend it.

· Enter the command: (sleep 1000 ; sleep 1000 ; ls -alR / > flist &)

· Foreground sleep 2000
